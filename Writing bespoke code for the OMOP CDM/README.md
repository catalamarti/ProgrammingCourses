Bespoke code
========================================================================================================================================================

## Overview
The aim of these practicum is to apply and learn how to use the basic codes in R that allow you compute your own cohort, and analyse simple data.

## 2 tasks are proposed:
#### *Task 1 (Part 1) Basic commands*
The aim of this practical is to put in practice the explained commands with simple exercises. You are going to characterize and see the main tables of Eunomia.
#### *Task 2 (Part 2) Build cohort*
The aim of this practical is to build your own cohort using the explained commands.

## If you think that it is too much:
#### *Task 0 (Part 0) Undestand commands*
You can start just with the code that was shown in the theory session and try to understand step by step what's going on

## When finished task 2 or if you are and advanced user:
Try to use the same commands in your own data. The problems will increase as bigger the database and you will have to try to optimize the codes or be patient.
DISCLAIMER: not all the proposed codes are the more efficient ones.
